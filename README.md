# amc-gpt

`amc-gpt` is a static web site for interacting with generative AI models (currently OpenAI, but
potentially other providers as well in the future). Over and above the online ChatGPT and OpenAI
playground interfaces it provides for:

* Rich output, with the ability to render basic text styles (markdown), math, and some charts and  
  diagrams e.g. pie charts, gantt charts, mindmaps, flow diagrams etc. (mermaid). It also simulates
  multi-model *output* (but not input) by asking ChatGPT to describe images that it would like to accompany its responses, and then having those images generated and rendered inline.
* Common prompt-engineering techniques (with a bias towards deeper discussion) such as   
  chain-of-thought and reflection, as well as calling out of assumptions and showing follow-up 
  questions for exploring topics more deeply. I.e, things I have personally found to be useful to get
  the most out of ChatGPT for these kinds of use cases. The UI parses responses to separate thoughts and potential follow-ups from the main responses to make a more readable conversation.
* The ability to print your full chat history!
